# Instagram-Top-Comment-Bot-Advanced-
This is the Advanced Version of my Top Comment Bot

Written in Selenium and used with Google Cloud to create my own API with Google Sheets

This Bot was originally developed in 2020 and used up until 2021

It gets the top comment of any comment section by leaving a comment within 7 seconds or less. It also reads, or filters through the caption of any post and will leave a comment based off if a specific keyword is mentioned.

All the comments it would leave were held in my Google Sheets API. So for Example, if the Page that posted was CNN and it mentioned Joe Biden, it would leave a comment based on how well he is doing during his presidential run. The purpose of this bot is to take advantage of the massive amount of traffic these comments were exposed to, and direct them towards your personal brand page.
